# Summary of DGE workflow

**Homework: modify this file to analyze the MOV dataset, starting with Mov10_full_counts.txt in your data folder. Compare the "MOV10_knockdown" to the "control". Include a heatmap and a volcano plot** points = +10


```{r, message = FALSE}
## Setup
library(DESeq2)
```
We have detailed the various steps in a differential expression analysis workflow, providing theory with example code. To provide a more succinct reference for the code needed to run a DGE analysis, we have summarized the steps in an analysis below:

### 1. Import data into dds object:
```{r, eval = FALSE}

# Check that the row names of the metadata equal the column names
#  of the **raw counts** data
all(colnames(raw_counts) == rownames(metadata))

# Create DESeq2Dataset object
dds <- DESeqDataSetFromMatrix(countData = raw_counts, colData = metadata, 
                              design = ~ condition)

```

### 2. Exploratory data analysis (PCA & heirarchical clustering) - identifying outliers and sources of variation in the data:
```{r, eval = FALSE}

# Transform counts for data visualization
rld <- rlog(dds, blind = TRUE)

# Plot PCA
plotPCA(rld, intgroup = "sampletype")

# Extract the rlog matrix from the object
rld_mat <- assay(rld)

# Compute pairwise correlation values
rld_cor <- cor(rld_mat)

# Plot heatmap
pheatmap(rld_cor)
```

### 3. Run DESeq2:
```{r, eval = FALSE}

# **Optional step** - Re-create DESeq2 dataset if the design formula has changed after QC analysis in include other sources of variation

dds <- DESeqDataSetFromMatrix(countData = raw_counts, 
                              colData = metadata, design = ~ condition)

# Run DESeq2 differential expression analysis
dds <- DESeq(dds)

#  Output normalized counts to save as a file to access outside RStudio
normalized_counts <- counts(dds, normalized = TRUE)
    
write.table(normalized_counts, file = "data/normalized_counts.txt", 
            sep = "\t", quote = F, col.names = NA)

```

### 4. Check the fit of the dispersion estimates:
```{r, eval = FALSE}

# Plot dispersion estimates
plotDispEsts(dds)
```

### 5. Create contrasts to perform Wald testing on the shrunken log2 foldchanges between specific conditions:
```{r, eval = FALSE}

# Output results of Wald test for contrast
contrast <- c("condition", "level_to_compare", "base_level")

res <- results(dds, contrast = contrast)

coef = resultsNames(dds)

res_table <- lfcShrink(dds, coef = coef[2], res = res, 
                         type = "apeglm")
```

### 6. Output significant results:
```{r, eval = FALSE}
### Set thresholds
padj.cutoff <- 0.05
lfc.cutoff <- 0.58 ## change in expression of 1.5

# Turn the results object into a data frame
res_df <- res %>%
  data.frame() %>%
  rownames_to_column(var = "gene") 

# Subset the significant results
sig_res <- dplyr::filter(res_df, padj < padj.cutoff &  
                  abs(log2FoldChange) > lfc.cutoff)
```

### 7. Visualize results: volcano plots, heatmaps, normalized counts plots of top genes, etc.

### 8. Make sure to output the versions of all tools used in the DE analysis:
```{r}
sessionInfo()
```
