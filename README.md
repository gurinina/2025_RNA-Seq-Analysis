**Differential gene expression workshop**

### Description

This repository has teaching materials for a 1.5-day, hands-on Introduction to differential gene expression (DGE) analysis workshop. The workshop will lead participants through performing a differential gene expression analysis workflow on RNA-seq count data using R/RStudio. Working knowledge of R is required or completion of the [Introduction to R workshop](https://hbctraining.github.io/Intro-to-R/).

### Learning Objectives

QC on count data using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and hierarchical clustering
Using DESeq2 to obtain a list of significantly different genes
Visualizing expression patterns of differentially expressed genes
Performing functional analysis on gene lists with R-based tools
These materials are developed for a trainer-led workshop, but also amenable to self-guided learning.
